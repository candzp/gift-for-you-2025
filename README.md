# 🎁 Gift For You 2025

A simple, secure, and festive way to share digital gift card codes using QR codes

This project is designed for **personal gifting** (holidays, celebrations, thank-yous)

---

## ✨ How It Works

1. Each gift card code is **encrypted locally**.
2. A **secure URL** is generated and turned into a QR code.
3. The recipient scans the QR and lands on a festive web page.
4. They enter a **PIN** to unlock and copy their gift code.
5. The code is redeemed inside the **Lazada mobile app**.

🔐 The actual gift codes are **never stored or exposed publicly**.
